#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is an approach to software development which applies engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems
it has proven to be important in enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power and improve efficiency in different aspects of life like communication,advance healthcare,commerce and entertainment

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Object oriented programming  a programming method centered around the concept of objects its principles include encapsulation whivch rounds up data into a a single unit and restricts access this helpps protect the integrity of data by allowing access through specific methods
Artificial intelligence which is a set of technologies that enable computers to perfom a variety of advanced fuctions including the ability to see,understand and translate spoken and written language ,analyze data ,make recommendations,it also involves machines learning/or being trainedto fuction in such a way that would normally require human intelligenceor that which exceeds what humans can analyze  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning:involves clearly defining the the problem in the software target,outlining the objective of the software and having a rough plan on how the system will work 
it also helps analyse the resources needed and the cost of developing the software
2.analysis:inviolves gathering all the specific details for the system  determining the first ideas of prototype and requirement specifications which may include defining prototype system security requirements,evaluating alternative/existing protypes research and analysis to determine the needs of end users
3.Design:involves building the framework where the team outlines software funtionality and emphasis on outlining software structure ,navigation,user interface and daabase design it is an essential step in creating software that works efficiently and provides an excellent user experience
4.Coding:Engineers and developersnow convert design into code ,this step aims at developing a software that is functional ,efficient and user friendly using an appropriate programming language ,there is also code review to identify bugs 
5:Testing .involves quality inspection ,vulnerabilities are uncovered and identifying individual components to ensure seamless operation of the system ,if a bug is identified it is documented,noted and its influence to the system noted and the bugs are sent back to developers for rectification ,this step is important in ensuring reliability of the system
6:Deployment. it involves pushing the tested and fine tuned system to its end users ,it signifies the shift from a project phase to to a product phase where the software begins to fulfill its purpose,it may also involve creating manuals ,offering trainings to users or offering onsite support
7.Maintanance .it is usually characterized by constant assistance and improvement of the system ,fixing bugs ,implementing patches and helping users facing difficulties with the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model is linear and involves phase by phase approach before moving to the next step while agile model is about adaptability and progress 
waterfall model intial requirements are rigid and well defined  while agile intial requirements are flexible and open to changes
waterfall planning is done upfront and changes are not easily accomodated while agile plannimg is iterative and evolves as project progressses
waterfall projects have clearly defined end point while Agile the project may continue to evolve. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developers create the computer applications that allows users to do specific tasks and the underlying systems that run the devices or control networks they analyze users needs and develop needs to meet those needs ,recommend software upgrades for existing systems,design each piece of the software and dictate how it works ,document every aspect of an application as a reference for future maintanance and upgrades
Quality assurance engineers design and excute systems to check the software for problems using either manual or automated programmes,they document and report defects or problems with the software and provide feedback to software developersand stakeholders regarding usability and functionality
project manager oversees the planning ,execution and delivery of software projects ,they align project objectives with business goals ,manage resources and mitigate risks

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   an IDE is a software suite that collects or consolidates basic tools required to write and test softwares ,developers use different tools for code creation and without an IDE it means he/she must intergrate or manage all the tools separately so an IDE combines all the tools together in a single graphical user interface .it improves developer productivity as it allows standardization across tools ,examples of IDE's include CLOUD 9,dreamweaver Xcode,eclipse
   Version control systems track and manage changes to software code /source code over time,they help teams solve or fix bugs by tracking individual changes by each individual contributor and helping prevent concurrent work from conflicting,they help make a complete long term change in each file,help in branching and merging and allows the ability to trace each change made to the software  examples include ;Git,monotone

 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.ensuring quality and reliabilty as building a software that is functional and free of bugs requires intense testing and quality assurance practices this can be eased by implementing automated testing frameworks to detect bugs and ensure code quality
2.managing complexity is also a problem for the software engineers and this can be eased by breaking down systems into manageable segments to simplfy development and maintenance and conducting of regualar code reviews to ensure consistency in detecting bugs and ensuring consistency
3.handling of security issues which can be subsidized by regualar audits to asses vulnerability and identify /address potential issues in the system
4.keeping up with rapid technological advancement as the tech field evolves pretty quick requiring them to learn new languages and methodologies this can be caught up with by continous learning which involves investing time in trainings and staying updates as well as participating in tech forums and conferences
5.scaling systems which involves creating softwares that perfom well under increasing loads efficientlycan be complex 
6.staying motivated and engaged as repetitive tasks and challanging problems can lead to loss of motivation  and by seeking out new challengesand contributing to open source projects and setting up personal goals to stay engaged and motivated.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing of individual components of a software application and is used to detect issues in the early stages of the development process and ensures that each part of code performs as expected
Integration testing focuses on the interaction between integrated components and is important in identifying issues in the way different modules work together ensuring that they function as a cohesive system 
System Testing involves testing the complete and intergrated software to verify that it meets specified/given requirements its key in validating overall perfomance of the system in an environment that resembles production
Acceptance testing is conducted by the clients to ensure the system or the application meets the business needs or requirements,this is important as it confirms that the system is ready for deployment /use 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is crafting of questions and statements to get the best possible responses from AI models,its important because it influences the relevance of the responses generated by AI by crafting clear and specific well structured prompts it helps improve accuracy ,enhance efficiency ,minimize ambiguity and provide guded responses

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
an example of a vague prompt is TELL ME ABOUT THE HISTORY OF KENYA 
improved one should be TELL ME ABOUT THE HISTORY OF KENYA BEFORE INDEPENDENCE
improved
